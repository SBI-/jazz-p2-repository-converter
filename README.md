# SDK to p2 repository converter
Command line scripts for converting a collection of java artifacts into a p2 repository.

## Abstract
In order to use the sdk files provided by IBM for development / debugging etc. with eclipse plugins, they have to be bundled as a p2 repository. These scripts provide the required functionality for creating a p2 repository on windows and linux.

To use the converted p2 repository as a maven dependency, which is required for compiling many of our projects, a local maven p2 repository has to be created. This is is explained in this readme.

## Prerequisites
1. Download and install eclipse
2. Download sdk
